#Introduction

Today we are going to talk about web accessibility.

So if we were to type the word "accessibility" into Google we might get the definition:

"The design of products, services and environments for people with disabilities."

If we extend that definition into the area of the *Internet* we might arrive at the phrase:

"Designing your site or application in such a way so that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate 
and interact with it easily and enjoyably."

While this is true, accessible design is more about designing for everyone.

The web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, culture, location, a
and also their physical and mental ability.
